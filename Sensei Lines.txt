"Welcome to BLOCKYSLICE!!!"
"My name is Sensei Square, and I'll be teaching you how to be"
"A SHAPE NINJA MASTER"

"In this game, you will SLICE SEEMLY SHAPES using SAMURAI SWORDS!"
"Here! Test it out now!"

1) Player misses shape completely: "Um... How about we try that again?"
2) ELSE: "NICE!"

"Now, you may have noticed that time went a bit slow during your swing."
"This is because you are using your FOCUS BAR"
"This special ability hones your senses and will let you see time in SLO-MO!"
"But be careful!"
"If you focus runs out, then you will be too tired to SLICE!"

"Now, young grasshopper, there are two ways for you to hone your skills:"
"CREATIVE MODE and SURVIVAL MODE"
"In CREATIVE MODE, you will be given a shape to slice into a specific shape,"
"And you'll be awarded focus depending on how close to the desired shape you SLICE"
"In SURVIVAL MODE, you will face an onslaught of shapes!"
"Your goal is to slice the shape into as SMALL a speck as POSSIBLE!"
"Your focus will continuously recharge, but there's a catch!"
"If a shape falls to the floor, you'll lose an amount of focus proportional to how big that shape is"
"So be vigilant for SURPRISES!"

"Now, begin training, we will..."

***FADE TO GAME MODE SELECTION***

***EVERY TEN SHAPES SLICED***
"EXCELLENT WORK!"
"WELL DONE"
"WOAH THERE!"
"Once, I got on the 28X to go to Squirrel Hill. Whoops, RHOMBUS!"
"Let me tell you about the time I sparred with Sir Cumference..."

***GAME OVER***
"We'll get 'em next time..."
"Hey, there's no need to get bent out of shape..."
"What an unshapely outcome..."
